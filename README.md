IDEAS

1. a program that determines when the internet is down and somehow announces to everyone that it's down

2. social credit app

3. something with geo location

4. stalker aka ebout aka fullow
  - scrape picture
  - scrape game stats
  - use APIs such as twitter to get recent posts
  - geolocation of person
  - modular add on to scrape whatever the user wants

5. survey app
  - for classrooms like ours
  - could be anonymous
  - emails sent to members of group everytime instructor sets up a new survey

6. hand-writing-font randomizer
  - for fonts that are supposed to look like handwriting/graffiti/calligraphy/etc
  - so an 'e' doesn't look just like every other 'e'
    - create several *similar* fonts
    - each character in the document has it's font chosen randomly from the above font-group

7. easy-to-use database viewer (like base)

8. online board game platform
  - inspired by roll20.net
  - play boardgames online with friends
  - integrate google hangouts video chat
  - most boardgames could be recreated with just the following components, none of which would be too hard to implement:
  - dice
  - tokens
  - cards
  - the board
  - modular system, allow users to create their own game setup
  - initially just use an honor system - don't need to enforce the rules of the game in-app
  - potentially implement rule support if we have time
